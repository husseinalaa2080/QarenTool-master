# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#     I18n.t 'hello'
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#     <%= t('hello') %>
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#     I18n.locale = :es
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
